# README

Note: *Please* read this readme carefully. 
*Onboarding instructions and tasks are listed throughout this readme.*
The tasks shown throughout the readme are what we (Chelsey & Edith) will need to show that your local env is setup, you can commit to the repo, *and* you have completed onboarding.
If you need assistance with *any* step of onboarding, please reach out to Chelsey + Edith through email or on Slack. 

HAPPY CODING! 

### Project: Innocent Tech 

For this cohort, you will be working on the educator user of an application called 'Innocent Tech.'

#### TailwindCSS 
The CSS Framework we will be using for this project is called TailwindCSS.
More information on the framework can be found here: https://tailwindcss.com/
We recommend reading up on the documentation, and syntax some before beginning the first sprint. 
Setting up your local environment should install Tailwind for this application.


### Environment Setup
This setup assumes you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on a Mac. 
Other environment setups are TBD.

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone = git@github.com:softwareforgood/innocent_tech_app.git
```

Alternately, if you don't already have an SSH key setup with Github:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/softwareforgood/innocent_tech_app.git
```

#### Ruby

- [Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/) (see [.ruby-version](./.ruby-version) for the version used for this app)
- [bundler](https://bundler.io/) â€” `gem install bundler`

If you don't have a Ruby version manager, you'll want to install `rbenv`. If you
already have `rbenv` or `rvm` installed, skip this step.

To find out if you already have one of them installed, in a terminal run
```sh
which rbenv rvm
```

If you're using `zsh` and you get the following, install `rbenv`:
```sh
rbenv not found
rvm not found
```

If you're using `bash` and there's no output at all, that means you don't have
either version manager installed, and you should install `rbenv`.

**DO NOT INSTALL BOTH RVM AND RBENV ON THE SAME MACHINE OR YOU WILL HAVE A VERY BAD TIME!**

*Check-in: I DO NOT have RVM and RBENV installed.* 
- [ ] Not at all! 
- [ ] Let me double check.... 

_Note: if you have `rvm` installed but would like to switch to `rbenv` (recommended),
just run the following before installing `rbenv`:_


```sh
rvm implode
```

**Install `rbenv`** (see https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv for more info)
```sh
brew install rbenv
```

Both `rbenv` and `rvm` will automatically try to use the version specified in a
local `.ruby-version` file if it exists. If the version specified in `.ruby-version`
is not installed, simply run:

```sh
rbenv install
```
Or for RVM:
```sh
rvm install
```

#### PostgreSQL
See if you have PostgreSQL:

```sh
psql --version
```

If it's not installed, or the version isn't >=11.0, install and run it using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install postgresql@12
brew services stop postgresql
brew services start postgresql@12
```

Create a db user:

```sh
psql -c "[authentication info here]';"
```

#### Redis - if not using using docker 

You'll need `redis` in order for `sidekiq` to work.

```sh
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

#### Rails

```sh
gem install bundler -v 2.3.7
bundle install # Make sure you're in the innocent_tech_app root directory
```

*If you get an error installing `pg` while running the `bundle install` command, it may be resolved
by running `brew install postgresql`, even if you have already installed `postgresql@11` or another
specific version of `postgresql`. Unlike when you installed `postgresql@11` above, you do not need
to start the `postgresql` service for this to fix your `bundle install` error.*

#### Javascript
You will need Yarn `v1.22.x`, a Node version manager (if you don't already have one, `nvm` is recommended), and Node `v16.x`.

```sh
brew install nvm yarn
nvm install && nvm use # This will install and use the version in the project's `.nvmrc` file
```

#### DB setup

Setup DB:

```sh
# From project root:
bin/rails db:setup # runs `rake db:create db:schema:load db:seed
```

or: 

```bash
bundle install
rails db:setup
```

*Check-in:Verify your db is ready to go*
- [ ] My db has been set up!  

##### Start the Rails server 

You can start the rails server using the command given below and visit the site with the URL http://localhost:3000

```ruby
rails s
```
*Check-in:Were you able to start your server?*
- [ ] Yes! Ready to go! 
- [ ] No, I need Chelsey, Edith, or one of my team mates to help me

##### Open a Rails console

```ruby
rails c
```
*Check-in: Can you start your rails console? *
- [ ] No, something is up
- [ ] Yes! Console started with not issue.

##### Run the linter

```bash
rails rubocop
```

*Check-in: Can you start your Rails linter? *
- [ ] Yes! Rubocop ready!
- [ ] No, I need Chelsey, Edith, or one of my team mates to help me

#### MiniTest / How To Run Tests 

For this application, we are using the testing library Minitest. 
To run the tests:

Open up a terminal
Navigate to the directory

```bash
rails test
```

or alternatively, 
```bash
Run ruby test_file_name.rb
```

Reading Minitest Output
Minitest runs the tests in a random order, and outputs a green dot for a successful test, a red E if there was an error while running the test, and a red F if the test assertion failed.

*Check-in: Are you  looking forward to writing tests?*
- [ ] Yes, of course!
- [ ] Its too early to tell 
- [ ] No, not really

#### Deployment Steps 
*Please* double check you can commit to this repo. Then, follow the deployment steps listed below. 
When you create your feature branch, follow this naming format for your branch: learn-earn-onboarding/[yourname]
*You only commit your Readme file with the checklist. No other files are needed!* 

  --commit your work on a feature branch
  --make a PR to the main branch
  --if PR approved, merge to main
  --cd back to main
  --pull the latest main branch

*Check-in: Do you prefer Front-End development or Back-End development?*
- [ ] Front end 
- [ ] Back end 
- [ ] I'm open to either 


*Final Check-in: How did local set up go?*

- [ ] Double checked that *all* the onboarding tasks on this readme
- [ ] I answered all of the check-in questions(including this one!) listed throughout this readme.
- [ ] I'm ready to submit this readme for review!
